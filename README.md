# Chasefor62
Chase for 62 is an interactive website that details Aaron Judge's chase
to be the American League Home Run King, passing Roger Maris' single season
record of 61 set in 1961. Each Homerun will include statistics like Launch Angle,
Exit Velocity, Distance, Pitcher, Inning, Ballpark, Men on Base, Score, and the Number Homerun hit by Judge. 

Aaron Judge put up one of the greatest seasons in MLB history and I wanted to use
my new knowledge of JavaScript to show how amazing he really is
